<h4>ㅤ2021년 보건복지부 조사 결과에 따르면, 전국 거리 노숙인 수 1600명 중 과반수 이상이 5년 이상 장기 거리 노숙인에 속합니다. 거리 노숙인의 경우 높은 유병률에 비해 저조한 병원 방문률을 보이고 있어, 건강 문제와 관련한 지속적인 지원이 필요한 상황입니다.

A 2021 Department of Health and Human Services survey revealed that the majority of the 1,600 individuals experiencing street homelessness nationwide have been doing so for five years or more. Despite the high prevalence of this issue, the street homeless population has low rates of healthcare visits, indicating a need for ongoing support for health issues.
